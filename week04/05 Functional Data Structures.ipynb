    "We call them \"persistent\" rather than \"ephemeral.\"\n",

    "It's possible that they might be less efficient. The OCaml compiler is good at making sure that things stay memory efficient. In terms of time complexity, sometimes functional data structures do increase time complexity. Usually, as a rule of thumb, you can assume that functional data structures increase time complexity by a logarithmic amount. "
