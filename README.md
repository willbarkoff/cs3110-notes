# CS 3110: Functional Programming and Data Structures

---

From the [Spring 2021 Class Roster](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP21/class/CS/3110):
> Advanced programming course that emphasizes functional programming techniques and data structures. Programming topics include recursive and higher-order procedures, models of programming language evaluation and compilation, type systems, and polymorphism. Data structures and algorithms covered include graph algorithms, balanced trees, memory heaps, and garbage collection. Also covers techniques for analyzing program performance and correctness.

This repository contains my notes from CS 3110 at Cornell University. It is organized by week.

These notes are _not_ a violation of the academic integrity policy. The academic integrity policy reads "You may not give your code to future CS 3110 students." These are notes, not useful code.

It also reads "You may not post your code to public websites or repositories." Once again, I don't think this is what is intended with the word "code." These are really notes, and there isn't actually useful code in here.

CS 3110's academic integrity policy is a superset of that of CS 1110, available [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2020fa/assessment/integrity/).
