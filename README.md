# CS 3110: Functional Programming and Data Structures

---

From the [Spring 2021 Class Roster](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP21/class/CS/3110):
> Advanced programming course that emphasizes functional programming techniques and data structures. Programming topics include recursive and higher-order procedures, models of programming language evaluation and compilation, type systems, and polymorphism. Data structures and algorithms covered include graph algorithms, balanced trees, memory heaps, and garbage collection. Also covers techniques for analyzing program performance and correctness.

This repository contains my notes from CS 3110 at Cornell University. It is organized by week.
